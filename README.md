# The I Was Bored After Work CMS

This is a Content Management System (CMS) created as a fun project, to spend my free time. The current goal is to have a Node.js server, a MongoDB database for the backend, and a Python desktop app for writers to add content to each site. 

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use system for managing content without the need for advanced coding knowledge (aka a 2024 Wordpress). Some key features include:

1. **Content Management**: A user-friendly interface for writers, similar to the ACF Wordpress plugin, to add and manage content easily.
2. **Multiple Domain Handling**: The system supports managing content across multiple domains.
3. **User Management**: A secure system to manage different writers, each with their own access and permissions.

## Features

- **Flexible Content Management**: Allow writers to add custom fields, media, and other types of content without writing code.
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Ability to manage several websites or projects simultaneously.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Each writer has their own secure account to manage content.


## Future Updates

Stay tuned for future updates! The project, just started and is continuously evolving, and I plan to add more features and improvements. Make sure to check back often for new releases and features.Feel free to contribute or follow the repository for the latest changes. Any new ideas are welcome.
